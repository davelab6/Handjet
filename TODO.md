# TODO

## Documentation

- [ ] document features (animals, symbols, patterns)

### Production backlog

- [ ] refactor automating the writing of the entire designspace on compile (e.g. adopt create-designspace-instances.py script to write out also axis mappings and sources) - the current designspace is based on a fontmake extracted designspace that was manually modified, but since the sources no longer contain those masters, there is no easy way to "recreate" that extracted designspace
