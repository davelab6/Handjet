# MenuTitle: reset component transformations

"""
Check all components in all selected glyphsâ€™ layers and remove any
mirror/rotation/skew but retain the current mathematical position.
Highlights any affected glyphs red and prints their affected layers to the
console.

NOTE: If a component is flipped the position is retained, however rotated or
skewed components might need to be manually repositioned
